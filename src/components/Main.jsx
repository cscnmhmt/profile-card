        As a developer with a year of experience in front-end development, I am
        passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
        I am currently learning Vue and am eager to expand my skills in this
        area. I am particularly skilled in CSS and enjoy designing websites that
        are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. I am highly motivated
        and dedicated to delivering high-quality web development solutions for
